# **Alphabet Soup Charity Optimization Report**

## **Overview**: The goal was to build and optimize a deep learning model to predict successful funding applications.

### **Results**:
  #### **Data Processing**:
  - What variable(s) are The target(s) for your model? 
  - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

  #### **Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

### **Visualizations** 

  ### **Summary**: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
